# Animated Eyes

This project is a simple, interactive web page that features a smiling face with eyes that follow the user's mouse movements. The face also changes expression when hovered over, simulating a mouth movement to make the face appear as if it's smiling wider.

Key Features:
1. Responsive Face Design: The face is created using CSS and is designed to be centered on the 
   page, making it responsive to different screen sizes.
2. Interactive Eyes: The eyes of the face follow the user's mouse movements, creating an engaging 
   and interactive experience.
3. Hover Effect: When the user hovers over the face, the mouth changes shape to simulate a wider 
   smile, adding a fun, dynamic element to the page.
